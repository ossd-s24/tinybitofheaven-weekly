title: Week 8 - Midterm Reflections & Group Projects Continue
---

I'm glad we picked Godot as our project, there seems to be much more to actively work on than we initially thought. While digging through the Godot repositories for issues to contribute to, we found a bunch of related Godot repositories such as 'godot-docs' or 'godot-benchmarks'. 'godot-docs', as you might expect, contained the documentation for Godot and was the main way to make contributions to their website. One of our team members made our group's first pull request through the 'godot-docs' repository.

I was more interested in working in the engine to start with, so I looked into 'godot-benchmarks'. This was a light Godot project that would test parts of the engine and benchmark engine elements for performance. A lot of the initial benchmarks were listed in an issue labeled 'TRACKER'. Looking through this issue, I found that a lot of the benchmarks were not finished yet and I could easily try my hand at some of the 2D Light benchmarks. With that said, I asked to work on the 2D point light and 2D directional light issues and have been working on that since.
